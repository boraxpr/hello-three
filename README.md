# ⚔️Welcome to my Three.js exploratory project⚔️

## Overview

The project aims to explore the Three.js library and its possibilities.

## Motivation

I came across so many amazing projects using Three.js that I wanted to try it myself.
I started with the [three.js Official Docs : Intro #Creating a scene](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) and then I tried to make my own project.

## How to run the project

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.

### Install the dependencies

```npm install```

### Run the project

```npx vite```
